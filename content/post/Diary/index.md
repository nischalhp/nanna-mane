# Social Distancing, Covid-19, Germany

2020 has been a weird year for everyone on planet earth. It started off with Australian bush fires, the breakout of Covid-19 in China, mother in-law falling terribly ill and the outbreak of Covid-19 all across the world. During this time, I have had to lead my life in Germany with my partner 5000 miles away taking care of her parents during this tough time. I cannot but miss her. Miss all the quirks and things that only I know about her and she about me. It brings a smile to my face when I type this, but the last 3 years have been wonderful in getting to know her and more about myself. 

The situation reminds me of the dialogue in the movie #goodwill hunting, where Robin Williams tells Matt Damon about all the small quirks you miss that only your partner knows. Robin Williams points out how his partner/wife would fart in her sleep, one day so loudly that it woke up the dog.

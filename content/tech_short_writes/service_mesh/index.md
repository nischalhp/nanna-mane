Currently, evaluating istio as a service mesh for our offering to enterprise insurance customers. With istio, we are evaluating https between pods and telemetry. Istio is a recent addition to the services supported on kubernetes, that helps monitoring applications on a provided infrastructure for kubernetes in a meaningful way. Its quite powerful and I am excited to be working with it.
